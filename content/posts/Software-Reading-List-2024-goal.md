Well, there are certain books I've been pushing back on reading but I think I honestly can't do that anymore.
They include:
1. Clean Code by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)
2. Clean Architecture by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)
3. The Book (for rustaceans) if you catch my drift.
4. Crafting Interpreters (https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html).
