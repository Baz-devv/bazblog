A software engineer is only as good as there last project.

Now, this list contains projects/challenges I find to be interesting and haven't just included them for the sake of sounding technical.

They include:

1. Writing an image compression algorithm.

2. Writing my own Docker-like container service.

3. Build an interpreter and a compiler. Preferrably in Rust, but I'll have to start with the Bob Nystrom book. Reading material:

	a. Crafting interpreters *already in my software reading list.

	b. Rust interpreters: https://rust-hosted-langs.github.io/book/

4. Concurrency algorithms.

     a. Producer-consumer

     b. Dining philosophers

     c. Readers-writers

As I build I'll be documenting my progress on this site.
