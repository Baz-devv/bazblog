I don't want to be bogged down just reading software books, that would be mind numbingly tedious.
To spice it up I've set myself the 24-book challenge for this year.

1. Half a Day `and other short stories.`

2. Astropysics For People In A Hurry by (Neil DeGrasse Tyson).

3. The Case Of The Man Who Died Laughing by (Tarquin Hall).

4. Devil On The Cross by (Ngugi wa Thiong'o).

5. The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.

6. **Lords of Poverty by (Graham Hancock).
