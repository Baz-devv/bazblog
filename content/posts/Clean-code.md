Many a developer preach the gospel of clean code but how many have actually read the book? Granted this book isn't the be all end all of clean-code but it's definitely the industry standard.

As the book alludes to, there are developers with 'code-sense' who are able to pick up clean-code naturally while some of us have acquire it the hard-way, we put ourselves through a Rocky like training montage 
of constantly reading, writing and refactoring code in order to get it to the accepted industry standards and as you probably might know programmers are a difficult bunch to please. 

This is my chapter by chapter summary of Clean Code by Robert Martin(Uncle Bob), and I hope at the end I'll be well on my way to acquiring 'code-sense'.
