Many a developer preach the gospel of clean code but how many have actually read the book? Granted this book isn't the be all end all of clean-code but it's definitely the interest standard.
As the book alludes to, there are developers with 'code-sense' who are able to pick up clean-code naturally while some of us have to do it the hard-way to acquire 'code-sense', we put ourselves through a Rocky like training montage 
of constantly reading, writing and refactoring code in order to get it to pass industry accepted standards. 

A chapter by chapter summary of Clean Code by Robert Martin(Uncle Bob).
