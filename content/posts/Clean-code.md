Many a developer preach the gospel of clean code but how many have actually read the book? Granted this book isn't the be all end all of clean-code but it's definitely the industry standard.

As the book alludes to, there are developers with 'code-sense' who are able to pick up clean-code naturally while some of us have to acquire it the hard-way, we put ourselves through a Rocky like training 
of constantly reading, writing and refactoring code in order to get it to the accepted industry standards and as you probably might know programmers are a difficult bunch to please so I guess it's a hopeless task.. 

This is my chapter by chapter summary of Clean Code by Robert Martin(Uncle Bob), some parts verbatim others not so much. I hope at the end I'll be well on my way to acquiring 'code-sense'.


### CHAPTER 1: CLEAN CODE.

I just have to get this out of the way first, "The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute.

## There will be code.

There's always talk of will there be need for programmers in the future or will there be machines to replace them? Well this author believes good-programmers will always be needed and in demand but 
I bet he to is feeling the heat generated by AI, advancements in this field surely cannot be ignored but we embrace it not fear it.

## Bad code

Bad code has the effect of slowing down teams and reducing productivity, if you understand the butterfly effect, you'll agree when someone says bad code could bring organisations to their knees, more on this
later.

WADING => The act of being impeded by bad code.

## The total cost of owning a mess.

As the mess(bad code) builds, the productivity continues to decrease, asymptomatically approaching zero and as this happens, management does the only thing they can, add more staff with hope that productivity
picks up but we know to well it won't as they haven't addressed the underlying issue. I hope you can now start seeing the cost of the mess in tangible detail.

## The grand redesign in the sky.

Let's build a new sytem to replace this new one. We'll use a new flashy language that the programmers now have to pick up, dangle all the trendy tech buzzwords to management so they allow a redesign and promise
heaven on earth with the new system. 

Every programmer gets to experience the above scenario a few times in their career. The team lead probably convinced you the switch from JavaScript to Rust is beacause Rust is blaingly fast and you ate up that 
lie with glee.

The truth of the matter is that your current system has bad code, don't get me wrong rust is way faster than js, so every few years you'll always find yourself redesigning instead maintaining good code and the
cycle of bad code continues.

Spending time keeping your code clean isn't just cost effective, it's a matter of professional survival.

## Attitude.

Why does good code rot so quickly into bad code?


To list a few reasons:
1. complaints that requirements changed in ways that thwart the original design.
2. complaints that schedules were to tight to do things right.

These are just excuses, programmers are deeply complicit in the planing of the project and share a great deal of the responsibility for any failures.

## The primal conundrum.
The only way to make the deadline - the only way to go fast - is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

## The art of clean code.
How do I write clean code?

Well first you must know what it means for code to be clean.

This really hurt my pride a bit "being able to recognize clean code from dirty code doesn't mean we know how to write clean code". A programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen 
through a series of transformations until it is an elegant coded system.
